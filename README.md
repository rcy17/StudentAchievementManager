A homework for C++

Maybe it's simply, stupid and old-fashioned, but it's just a private repository. Who cares? 2333333

However, I change it as pulic on 2018/10/13, maybe somebody will see this, maybe not. Anyway, I won't update new commit for this reposity. But if you have any question about some details, I will be glad to check issues.
